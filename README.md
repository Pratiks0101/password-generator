This is a random and securred password generator file.

# Professional Password Generator
A responsive, logic-based web application designed to generate secure, randomized passwords. This project was built to demonstrate my transition back into hands-on Full-Stack development, focusing on clean JavaScript logic and user-centric design.

## Features
Security Constraints: Options to include Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters.

Instant Feedback: Real-time generation using optimized JavaScript Math functions.

Responsive Design: Fully functional across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Architecture: Functional Programming approach for modularity and readability.

## My Perspective

Randomization Logic: Utilizing ```Math.random()``` combined with character-set mapping to ensure high entropy.

Code Scalability: The logic is structured so that upperCase, lowerCase, uniqueCharacters, symbols and numbers are included..
